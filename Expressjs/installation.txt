Install Express.js

Firstly, you have to install the express framework globally to create web application using Node terminal. 
Use the following command to install express framework globally.

npm install -g express  

npm install express --save   

The above command install express in node_module directory and create a directory named express inside the node_module. 
You should install some other important modules along with express. Following is the list:

body-parser: This is a node.js middleware for handling JSON, Raw, Text and URL encoded form data.
cookie-parser: It is used to parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.
multer: This is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data.
npm install body-parser --save   
npm install cookie-parser --save   
npm install multer --save  

Express.js App Example
Let's take a simple Express app example which starts a server and listen on a local port. It only responds to homepage.
For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found error.

File: express_example.js  
var express = require('express');  
var app = express();  
app.get('/', function (req, res) {  
   res.send('Welcome to JavaTpoint');  
})  
var server = app.listen(8000, function () {  
var host = server.address().address  
  var port = server.address().port  
 console.log("Example app listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)  
})  

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to see the result.
