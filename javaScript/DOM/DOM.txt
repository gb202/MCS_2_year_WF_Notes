DOM: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. 
JavaScript can not understand the tags in HTML document but can understand objects in DOM. 
(The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. 
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.)

There are many different ways to build and alter HTML elements with JavaScript called nodes. 
Below are some of the methods provided by JavaScript to manipulate these nodes and their attributes in the DOM:
appendChild()	It adds a new child node as the last child node to an element.
cloneNode()	It is a function that duplicates an HTML element.
hasAttributes()	It returns true If an element has any attributes otherwise, it returns false.
removeChild()	It removes a child node from an element using the Child() method.
getAttribute()	It returns the value of an element node’s provided attribute.
getElemetsByTagName()	It returns a list of all child elements whose tag name is supplied.
isEqualNode()	It determines whether two elements are the same.

Note: It is called a Logical structure because DOM doesn’t specify any relationship between objects. 

DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. 
With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements of HTML using commands or methods provided by the Document object.
Using DOM, the JavaScript gets access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also add behavior to the HTML elements. 
so basically Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML documents.

Why DOM is required?

HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. 
When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the HTML document directly. 
So, a corresponding document is created(DOM). DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects. 
Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM. 
Now, Javascript can access each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.

Structure of DOM: DOM can be thought of as a Tree or Forest(more than one tree). The term structure model is sometimes used to describe the 
tree-like representation of a document.  Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects 
Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on an occurrence of a given event. One important property of DOM structure models is structural 
isomorphism: if any two DOM implementations are used to create a representation of the same document, they will create the same structure model, 
with precisely the same objects and relationships.

Why called an Object Model?
Documents are modeled using objects, and the model includes not only the structure of a document but also the behavior of a document and the 
objects of which it is composed like tag elements with attributes in HTML.

Properties of DOM: Let’s see the properties of the document object that can be accessed and modified by the document object.

Window Object: Window Object is object of the browser which is always at top of the hierarchy.  It is like an API that is used to set and access all the properties and methods of the browser. It is automatically created by the browser.
Document object: When an HTML document is loaded into a window, it becomes a document object. The ‘document’ object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of the content of the web page. If there is a need to access any element in an HTML page, we always start with accessing the ‘document’ object. Document object is property of window object.
Form Object: It is represented by form tags.
Link Object: It is represented by link tags.
Anchor Object: It is represented by a href tags.
Form Control Elements:: Form can have many control elements such as text fields, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
Methods of Document Object:

write(“string”): Writes the given string on the document.
getElementById(): returns the element having the given id value.
getElementsByName(): returns all the elements having the given name value.
getElementsByTagName(): returns all the elements having the given tag name.
getElementsByClassName(): returns all the elements having the given class name.
