  A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location.
  There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
  There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.

correct method
var x = 10;
var _value="sonoo";

wrong method
var  123=30;
var *aa=320;


  <!-- LOCAL VARIABLE -->

  <html>
    <body>
      <!--
      <p>LOCAL VARIABLE</p>
      <script>
        var x = 10;
        var y = 20;
        var z=x+y;
        document.write(z);
      </script>
      -->
      <p>Gobal VARIABLE</p>
      <script>
        var data=200;//gloabal variable
        function a(){
          document.writeln(data + "<br>");
        }
        function b(){
          data1 = 50
          data = 10
          document.write(data1)
          document.writeln(data);
          //writeln() adds a newline character after each statement. write() does not.
        }
        a();//calling JavaScript function
        b();
</script>
    </body>
  </html>

Note
It makes no sense to use writeln() in HTML.

It is only useful when writing to text documents (type=".txt").

Newline characters are ignored in HTML.

If you want new lines in HTML, you must use paragraphs or <br>:
